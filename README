ValidField
==========

This plugin adds the method #valid_field? to ActiveRecord::Base.

The purpose is to not worry about calling validation and checking errors[...] every time you want to know about a field.

It is not efficient, but it works.

Example
=======

user = User.new
unless user.valid_field? :name
  raise "I don't talk to strangers"
end
